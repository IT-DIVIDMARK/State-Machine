Creating a state machine using Arduino is a great way to manage complex logic and control the behavior of your system. When documenting this process for Git, it's essential to include a clear and comprehensive description that covers the project's purpose, setup, usage, and any other relevant information. Here's a sample template that you can use to create your Git documentation:

Project Title
State Machine Implementation Using Arduino

Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a state machine on an Arduino microcontroller. The state machine is designed to control the behavior of a specific system by transitioning between different states based on defined conditions. This documentation serves as a guide for understanding the setup, operation, and customization of the state machine code on the Arduino platform.
